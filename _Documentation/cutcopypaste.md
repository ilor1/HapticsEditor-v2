# Cut/Copy And Paste

documentation in work...

1. Place markers by `Left-Clicking` and `Shift-Left-Clicking` on the `timelabel-bar` between the funscript area and the waveform.
2. `Cut` or `Copy` the funscript between the markers by pressing `Ctrl-X` or `Ctrl-V`.    
3. Paste the funscript starting from where the cursor is by pressing `Ctrl-V`, or ending where the cursor is by pressing `Shift-Ctrl-V`

#### The actions between the markers can also be `scaled up/down` with the `scroll-wheel`, except in the Pattern Scripting Mode. 

#### Note: Cut-Copy-Paste works only when a single layer is selected. You can however (as an example) `Cut from Layer1` and then `Paste to Layer2` by juggling the selections.
